# JDK 11 and Android 30
# JETPACK COMPOSE 

# Match Group Test App
This application uses Jetpack Compose to display a list of Reviews of a Coffee Shop in the 
San Diego area.

The MainActivity shows the list and clicking on a Review Item opens up the Review Details Activity.

The Review Details Activity shows the Location of the Coffee Shop, Details and Rating

Since the Jetpack Compose didn't have out of the box RatingBar widget, the value of the rating is
displayed in the Text widget instead.
